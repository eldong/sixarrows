      <span class="style4"><font size="4">Hello! My name is Sara Gormsen 
    and I must write down my testimony in praise to God Almighty for all He has 
    done!!!! I am overflowing with great joy as I get the opportunity to share 
    how God through His Precious Son Jesus Christ has used WeighDown to change my life 
    FOREVER!</font> </span>      <p class="style4"><font size="4">Before God brought WeighDown to our local church-I cried out to 
        God to fear Him because I knew the Bible said it was the beginning of wisdom 
        and I KNEW I didn’t fear Him and had no idea how to even begin. Also, 
        right before God put WeighDown in my life, on the way back home from church 
        one Sunday, I asked my husband and confessed that I HAD NO IDEA how to KNOW 
        God. The Word was “dry” and I had gotten in such a pit I had no idea even 
        how to have a “quiet time” with Him. He tried to help, but really it was the 
        blind leading the blind. I was sitting on the church pew heading straight 
        down the wide path to hell and HAD NO IDEA.. I was so sick, naked, blind, and 
        wretched. But to everyone else it looked like I had it all together-beautiful 
        sweet children (which I was ruling at home with anger and without very much 
        1 Cor. 13 love) always at church (from cleaning to nursery to running the 
        children’s ministry to baby showers galore) &amp; looking like I submitted to my 
        husband (but truly had no respect for him when his ideas differed from mine). 
        Do you know what, tho? My standard was everyone else in the church instead 
        of Jesus Christ - the plumbline of righteousness. Truly I was more 
        submissive, more of a servant, more godly than most people in the church. 
        Yet, I knew even then that all these things I did were not TRULY for God’s 
        glory, but for myself, and they would burn up.</font></p>      <p class="style4"><font size="4">So with incredible mercy and love God let me be part of WeighDown, I 
        reluctantly signed up for WeighDown 6 months pregnant with our 5th child. 
        I knew I needed SOMETHING, because gaining over 10lbs in one month was TOO 
        MUCH! I had heard of WeighDown before, but because of shameful pride I 
        thought once a week and $100 was embarrassing to admit to and commit to 
        because of my weight problem.</font></p>      <p class="style4"><font size="4">Well, from the beginning I KNEW Gwen Shamblin KNEW God as she snuggled up 
        on that couch and shared what her relationship was like with her Father. I 
        had never heard of that from anyone. I also knew IMMEDIATELY when she told 
        us that overeating was sin, an idol, and a huge heart problem-it was 
        TRUTH!!! It was like a huge light bulb went on, I praise God for showing me 
        my sin! I knew I’d never go to any other diet or program-praise God that I 
        knew this was the path to freedom in Christ and abundant life that Jesus 
        talked about! WeighDown Advanced set it all more straight and clear, and I 
        praise God He allowed me to see that mySELF had set itself up inside this 
        body, God's temple, because I ruled most of the time! </font></p>      <p class="style4"><font size="4">I have counted the cost and I have sold EVERYTHING to find this God and 
        His Kingdom!!! I will never go back as each day I am thrilled to even be 
        alive to serve the Great I Am . My pre-pregnancy weight was right about 
        168lbs before WD. God has taken 5olbs of greed from me and I now weigh 
        118lbs. I could go on and on with the blessings and jewels from my 
        sweet Father. He has been way too good to me and our family! May you see 
        that HE alone gets all the praise and glory and that this lamb has followed 
        the VOICE of Jesus Christ my Shepherd! </font></p>      <p class="style4"><font size="4">God allowed me also to be introduced to what Remnant Fellowship was like 
        at Desert Oasis 2000 in Nashville.&nbsp; I wanted that fellowship with all 
        my heart.&nbsp; I saw people pouring over tons of Scripture together, 
        testifying of changed lives, children worshiping with parents, and sweet, 
        happy peace on these believers faces!&nbsp; As my husband explains in his 
        testimony~he apposed this greatly.&nbsp; But God has worked out EVERYTHING 
        for good to those who love Him and are called according to HIS purpose!!</font></p>      <p class="style4"><font size="4">We believe that Jesus' shed blood gave us the most incredible wonderful 
        opportunity to know God our Father by forgiving our past sins.&nbsp; That 
        same Jesus taught that we must lose our life and then we will find it. He 
        said to go and sin no more.&nbsp; He taught if you had sin, to cut it off, 
        because it is better to go to heaven without it then to hell with it.&nbsp; 
        All His life on earth and all the way to the cross, He said not His will, 
        but the Father's be DONE!&nbsp; And finally our Lord Jesus Christ said, &quot;Not 
        everyone who says to me, &quot;Lord, Lord&quot; will enter the kingdom of heaven, but 
        only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.&quot; Matt. 7:21&nbsp; 
        God would be a cruel God if he asked us to obey if we couldn't!&nbsp; HE is 
        NOT a cruel God, but the most Loving, Wonderful, Mighty, Awesome God who wants to 
        lead and call a people His own.&nbsp; WE CAN OBEY HIM TOTALLY and make Him 
        our Sovereign God!!</font></p>      <p class="style4"><font size="4">&quot;We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands.&nbsp; The 
        man who says, &quot;I know him,&quot; but does not do what he commands is a liar, and 
        the truth is not in him.&nbsp; But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is 
        truly made complete in him.&nbsp; This is how we know we are in him:&nbsp; 
    Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1John 2:3-6</font></p>      <p class="style4"></td>

      <font size="4">My name is 
    Eldon Gormsen and I would like to share my story of God’s working in my 
    life.</font></p>
    <p class="style2 MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 0" title="Remnant Fellowship Church"><strong>
      <font size="4">Although 
    there is much to say prior to the fall of 2002 I would like to start my 
    story there. It was in the fall of 2000 that God provided me with a new job 
    in Minnesota.&nbsp; After living in the same town for 15 years our family packed 
    up,&nbsp; moved and left our church home at which I was an elder.&nbsp; The next 10 months of our lives 
    would be some of the most difficult times that Sara and I had in our 14 
    years of marriage. During this time I was an active persecutor of&nbsp; 
    this message of Jesus Christ and Remnant Fellowship, and&nbsp; especially His servant, my wife.&nbsp; I 
    say this to my shame.&nbsp;</font></strong></p>
    <p class="style2 MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 1" title="Remnant Fellowship Church"><strong>
      <font size="4"><br>
      For 10 months I was a prideful, mad and angry person with the majority of 
    that anger directed towards Sara.&nbsp; All during this time she was loving 
    me more, being more submissive, living a live that was condemning my own, 
    and&nbsp; looking a lot better than she had in 10 years!</font></strong></p>
    <p class="style2 MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 1" title="Remnant Fellowship Church"><strong>
      <font size="4"><br>
      But also during all of this time God was working on my heart.&nbsp; I had started 
    to read the Bible more and spend more time in prayer and seeking Him.&nbsp; 
    Starting in the early part of July I had 4 long business trips during which 
    I had lots of time to read, pray and listen to God.&nbsp; It was during one of 
    these trips while out in California that I called Sara one day and told her 
    that “I am starting to get it”.&nbsp; I could feel the veil being lifted.&nbsp; 2 
    Corinthians 3: 16 says &quot;But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is 
    taken away.&quot;&nbsp; I was seeing that obeying God is not a work, following 
    man made rules (do not eat this, do not drink, certain music, movies are 
    bad)&nbsp; is what Paul means when he talks about works (Read Romans 
    6,7,8!).&nbsp; I was also understanding what it meant to be baptized into 
    Christ’s death and from now on I am to be dead to the sinful nature and 
    alive to Spirit that is living in me.&nbsp; I saw that God’s grace teaches me to 
    say no to sin, and that I mock God if I think I can continue to deliberately 
    sin (Hebrews 10:26-31). I see that everyday I make a choice of who I am 
    going to serve, God or myself and I can not claim to be a believer in Jesus 
    if I am serving myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; From that time till now, 3 months later, God 
    has done an incredible work in my life.&nbsp; I recognize that there were 
    mountains of sin in my life that I had been blinded too on top of the 
    numerous sins that I knew about but thought that God would overlook because 
    he loved me so much.&nbsp; </font></strong></p>
    <p class="style2 MsoNormal" title="Remnant Fellowship Church"><strong>
      <font size="4">&nbsp;Here are a 
    few of the changes God has made in my life now that I am seeking to do His 
    will every moment of everyday.</font></strong></p>

      <font size="4">Words cannot 
    express the amount of joy peace that I have now in my life. I have lost over 
    50 lbs, but more importantly I am a new creation from the inside out.&nbsp; I 
    never will go back to the way my life was before.&nbsp; My heart breaks for 
    those people who are searching for the same thing but cannot find it.&nbsp; It is really so very simple - just do what Gods asks you to do every moment 
    of everyday.</font></strong></p>

      The apostle Paul summed it up while under trial in Rome when he said &quot;So 
    then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven. First 
    to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to 
    the Gentiles also, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and 
    prove their repentance by their deeds.”&nbsp; Acts 16:19-20</font></strong></p>

&nbsp;I am so thankful that God has lifted the veil from my eyes.&nbsp; I now truly do 
    see and understand what His will for me is and God’s word has become alive to me.&nbsp; God has worked a 
    miracle in my life and has given me the life that I have sought after for 
    many years but was unable to attain because I was not giving total control 
    to God and obeying Him in every area of my life.&nbsp; In three months God has 
    transformed not only my life, but my marriage and my relationship with my 
    children.&nbsp; My life seems like a dream, I have an incredible marriage, 
    obedient children, and an overflowing thankfulness and love for God.&nbsp; I 
    thank him everyday that he has chosen me and my family to be set free.&nbsp; It 
    is an incredible feeling.&nbsp; Praise God for all the faithful people who are 
    apart of these awesome Remnant Fellowships across the country, you all have 
    had an impact on my life.&nbsp; A special thanks to the leadership at Nashville, 
    Gwen, David, Ted and the rest, you are a shining example of the kind of 
    leader that I love to follow.&nbsp; A special thanks to my beautiful wife Sara.&nbsp; She 
    endured much suffering and persecution from me.&nbsp; All of the anger, yelling, 
    silence, frustration, threats, that she had to endure she did with a 
    humble, servants heart.&nbsp; Thank you for taking a stand and doing what God asked 
    you to do when the easy way would have been to do it my way.&nbsp; Someday I pray 
    that God will allow me to have your humble servant attitude.</font></strong></p>
